# Structuring logic and data

Clone this repository and create you own unique branch (based on your github username).

Add a folder with your name (e.g. "henninghorn") within the project folder.
Go into that folder and a index.html file and a javascript.js file.
Save you progress in these files and remember to commit and push to github.

When you are done, commit and push, and make a pull-request to the master branch.
